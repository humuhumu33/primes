# UOR/Prime Axioms Factorizer

A pure mathematical implementation of integer factorization based on the Universal Object Reference (UOR) and Prime Model axioms. This project implements deterministic factorization through wave-particle duality, coherence fields, and self-referential mathematics.

## Overview

The factorizer implements five fundamental axioms that work together to find factors of composite numbers:

1. **Prime Ontology** - Prime numbers as fundamental building blocks
2. **Fibonacci Flow** - Golden ratio and Fibonacci sequences as natural organizing principles  
3. **Duality Principle** - Wave-particle duality applied to number theory
4. **Observer Effect** - Adaptive observation that changes based on measurement
5. **Self-Reference** - The system observes its own patterns to improve

## Key Features

- **NO FALLBACKS** - Pure axiomatic implementation, no probabilistic methods
- **NO RANDOMIZATION** - Completely deterministic algorithms
- **NO SIMPLIFICATION** - Full implementation of all mathematical principles
- **NO HARDCODING** - All patterns emerge from the axioms

## Mathematical Foundation

### Axiom 1: Prime Ontology
- Treats primes as fundamental coordinates in number space
- Implements prime cascades, geodesics, and pull forces
- Uses deterministic primality testing (no probabilistic methods)

### Axiom 2: Fibonacci Flow  
- Golden ratio (φ) as the universal organizing constant
- Fibonacci vortices create interference patterns
- Entanglement detection for Fibonacci-proximate factors

### Axiom 3: Duality Principle
- Numbers have both particle (factor) and wave (spectral) nature
- Coherence measures spectral similarity between factors
- Interference patterns reveal factor locations

### Axiom 4: Observer Effect
- Multi-scale observation (μ, m, M, Ω scales)
- Quantum superposition until measurement collapses to factors
- Resonance memory learns from successful factorizations

### Axiom 5: Self-Reference
- System observes its own observation patterns
- Detects blind spots and adapts strategies
- Synthesizes new methods from axiom combinations

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from axiom1 import primes_up_to, PrimeCascade
from axiom2 import FibonacciEntanglement
from axiom3 import coherence, FoldTopology
from axiom4 import MultiScaleObserver, ResonanceMemory
from axiom5 import MetaObserver, AxiomSynthesizer

# Factor a number
n = 143  # 11 × 13

# Try Fibonacci entanglement
ent = FibonacciEntanglement(n)
candidates = ent.detect_double()

# Use fold topology
topo = FoldTopology(n)
for component in topo.components():
    for x in component:
        if n % x == 0:
            print(f"Factor found: {x}")
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test individual axioms
python3 axiom1/test/run_all_tests.py
python3 axiom2/test/run_all_tests.py
python3 axiom3/test/run_all_tests.py
python3 axiom4/test/run_all_tests.py
python3 axiom5/test/run_all_tests.py

# Run comprehensive tests
python3 test/run_comprehensive_tests.py
```

## Implementation Principles

1. **Deterministic Only** - No random number generation or probabilistic algorithms
2. **Axiom-Based** - All methods derive from the five core axioms
3. **Emergent Behavior** - Complex patterns emerge from simple rules
4. **Self-Improving** - System learns from both successes and failures

## Mathematical Concepts

### Coherence
Measures how well two numbers "resonate" based on their spectral properties:
- Binary spectrum (bit patterns)
- Modular spectrum (remainders modulo small primes)
- Digital spectrum (digit sums and patterns)
- Harmonic spectrum (Fibonacci proximity)

### Spectral Folding
Numbers create "folds" in spectral space where factors are likely to exist:
- Sharp folds have high curvature in energy landscape
- Fold topology connects related positions
- Interference patterns amplify at factor locations

### Quantum Superposition
Before measurement, positions exist in superposition of states:
- Multiple axioms suggest different candidates
- Observation collapses superposition to actual factors
- Coherence drives the collapse process

### Meta-Observation
The system observes its own behavior:
- Tracks which axioms work for which number types
- Detects blind spots in coverage
- Synthesizes new methods from successful patterns

## Algorithm Flow

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Calculate spectral properties of n
   - Identify number characteristics
   - Select appropriate axioms

2. **Multi-Axiom Search**
   - Fibonacci entanglement detection
   - Sharp fold identification
   - Interference extrema
   - Prime cascade exploration

3. **Adaptive Observation**
   - Multi-scale coherence measurement
   - Quantum superposition generation
   - Resonance-guided navigation
   - Spectral gradient ascent

4. **Self-Reference**
   - Monitor observation patterns
   - Detect and avoid blind spots
   - Synthesize hybrid methods
   - Learn from failures

## Performance Characteristics

- Optimized for numbers with structure (not random)
- Learns from experience via resonance memory
- Adapts strategy based on number properties
- No worst-case exponential behavior by design

## Contributing

This implementation is based on pure mathematical axioms. Contributions should:
- Derive from the five core axioms
- Maintain deterministic behavior
- Include comprehensive tests
- Document mathematical reasoning

## License

This project implements mathematical axioms that are universal truths and thus in the public domain. The specific implementation code is provided as-is for educational and research purposes.
